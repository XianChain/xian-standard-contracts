# Standardized Smart Contracts for Xian Blockchain

Welcome to the official repository for standardized smart contracts on the Xian blockchain. This repository hosts a collection of foundational smart contracts developed in Contracting, the native smart contract programming language for Xian. These contracts are designed to provide a robust framework for building decentralized applications (dApps) and services on the Xian network.

## Introduction

The Xian blockchain is dedicated to offering a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly environment for decentralized applications and their users. The standardized smart contracts in this repository are a critical component of that mission, providing developers with reliable and tested building blocks for their applications.

## Contract Standards

Each contract in this repository follows a specific naming convention and standardization process to ensure consistency and quality. The first standardized contract, a token contract, is named `XSC001` and is located in the `token/XSC001` directory.

### Naming Convention

- **XSC###**: The prefix "XSC" stands for Xian Standard Contract, followed by a numerical identifier indicating the sequence of the standard.

### Available Contracts

- **Token Contract (XSC001)**
  - Location: `token/XSC001`
  - Description: This contract implements a basic token system, allowing for token transfer, approval mechanisms, and metadata management.
